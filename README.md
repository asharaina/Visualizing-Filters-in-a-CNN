# Visualizing-Filters-in-a-CNN

In this Coursera guided project, I learnt to use a Convolutional Neural Network - the popular VGG16 model, and visualized various filters from different layers of the CNN. I did this by using gradient ascent to visualize images that maximally activate specific filters from different layers of the model.
This project used TensorFlow as the machine learning framework and the  Google Colab environment as workspace.
